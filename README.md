# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). YumYumYum.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## Project Plan

- Assignment for Ohjelmistoprojekti II (Software Project II)
- Purpose of our project is to design a web application using open data

## Development Tools

- Web application created with React App
- Mockup created with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- As database using [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/)
- We are using [Edamam API](https://www.edamam.com/) to fetch recipes and ingredients

<sub>**Further development aims to expand the app to be mobile responsive**</sub>

## Yummyfier

- Food recipe web application for users interested in cooking
- App has various options and categories from vegetarian to meat
- App aims to reduce food waste, save time and inspire

Idea in short:
- Do you have ingredients but don't know what you can make of them
- Write your ingredient(s) to the app and it suggests recipe ideas that can be made of them
- Create an account, so that if you come to like any of the recipes you can save them to your profile and access them from all of your devices

<sub>**However, if you only have few basic ingredients (eggs, flours...) we can't ensure you can make something only with those**</sub>

## User Stories

- As an uninspired cook, I want to get ideas of what I can do with the random items in my fridge, so that I don't need to go to the store.
- As a User I want to be able to list ingredients I have to get recipes
- As a User I want to be able to save the recipes I really liked, so that I can use them again
- As a developer I want to have free and broad data which I can just fetch easily with no limits

## Target Audience

- The target audience for Yummyfier are individuals who are interested in cooking and are seeking inspiration for their meals
- This includes people who may not have a lot of experience in the kitchen and are looking for new recipe ideas, as well as experienced cooks who want to try out new dishes
- Yummyfier appeals to those who want to reduce food waste and save time by utilizing ingredients they already have on hand, rather than making an unnecessary trip to the store
- By allowing users to save recipes they enjoy, the app encourages repeat use
- Overall, Yummyfier is designed to meet the needs of a broad range of users who are interested in cooking, with a focus on simplicity, convenience, and accessibility.
