Business Information Technology degree programme at Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences

## Project Plan

- Assignment for Ohjelmistoprojekti II (Software Project II)
- Purpose of our project is to design a web application using open data

## Development Tools

- Web application created with React App
- Mockup created with Figma
- As database using Firebase Realtime Database
- We are using TheMealDB API to fetch recipes and ingredients

<sub>**Further development aims to expand the app to be mobile responsive**</sub>

## Yummyfier

- Food recipe web application for users interested in cooking
- App has various options and categories from vegetarian to meat
- App aims to reduce food waste, save time and inspire


Idea in short:
- You have ingredients in your fridge but you don't know what you can make of them
- Write your ingredient(s) to the app and it suggests recipe ideas that can be made of them
- Create an account, so that if you come to like any of the recipes you can save them to your profile and access them from all of your devices

<sub>**However, if you only have few basic ingredients (eggs, flours...) we can't ensure you can make something with those only**</sub>

## User Stories

- As an uninspired cook, I want to get ideas of what I can do with the random items in my fridge, so that I don't need to go to the store.
- As a User I want to be able to list ingredients I have to get recipes
- As a User I want to be able to save the recipes I really liked, so that I can use them again
- As a developer I want to have free and broad data which I can just fetch easily with no limits

## Target Audience

- The target audience for Yummyfier are individuals who are interested in cooking and are seeking inspiration for their meals
- This includes people who may not have a lot of experience in the kitchen and are looking for new recipe ideas, as well as experienced cooks who want to try out new dishes
- Yummyfier appeals to those who want to reduce food waste and save time by utilizing ingredients they already have on hand, rather than making an unnecessary trip to the store
- By allowing users to save recipes they enjoy, the app encourages repeat use
- Overall, Yummyfier is designed to meet the needs of a broad range of users who are interested in cooking, with a focus on simplicity, convenience, and accessibility.
